>Long variables are extended size variables for number storage, and store 32 bits (4 bytes).
>long long int data type in C++ is used to store 64-bit integers.
>A short type must be at least 16 bits wide. 
>A signed integer is a 32-bit datum that encodes an integer in the range [-2147483648 to 2147483647]. 
>An unsigned integer is a 32-bit datum that 
>encodes a nonnegative integer in the range [0 to 4294967295].
>Double is more precise than float and can store 64 bits

>2. rate:double because rate has to be precise and could be fraction.
>principal:Float because small fractional numbers.
>payment: int because, it cant be fractional value.
