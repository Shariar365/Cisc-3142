Int is a data type used to represent real numbers that do not have fractional values.

Long variables are extended size variables for number storage, and store 32 bits (4 bytes), 
from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.

long long int data type in C++ is used to store 64-bit integers.

A short type must be at least 16 bits wide. 

A signed integer is a 32-bit datum that encodes an integer in the range 
[-2147483648 to 2147483647]. An unsigned integer is a 32-bit datum that 
encodes a nonnegative integer in the range [0 to 4294967295].

Double is more precise than float and can store 64 bits
